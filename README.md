- Have an extra player to make two players

### Starting and Ending the game:
#### Starting:
##### Windows users
    - Open the windows console using window + r
    - Type cmd in the run space provided
    - Clear screen with the cls command on the black screen

- (Top/botton)/ (bottom/up) center part of the table
- (Left/Right)/ (Right/Left) center part of the table

Any thing out of these is a loss

## Testing:
### Specs
Passing specs for each of these methods have been written with each of them having not less than 2 examples. 
To use the tests, you need to:
 - Have Rspec installed
 - Have some basic knowledge on how to use rspec
 - Have an understanding of TDD
 
 #### Setting up rspec.
  - First check for the availability of rspec on your computer using *rspec -version*. This is should return the version(s) of    rspec you have installed or return an error showing that you do not have rspec installed
  - If you do not have it installed [click here for guidelines and the rest of steps to get you started](https://rspec.info/)
